## My process



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I can say that this challenge has given me a lot. The use of flexbox was not explained to me in the css trainings I received, but after doing some research, I learned to use flexbox for this project in a very short time. I am open to all feedback.



```css
.flex-container {
  background-color: white;
  border-radius: 0.625rem;
  text-align: center;
  flex-direction: column;
  max-width: 17rem;
  margin: auto;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
  padding: 1rem;
  box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  margin-top: 10%;
}
```

### Continued development

I intend to develop and use this template while developing my own web3 projects.



### Useful resources
